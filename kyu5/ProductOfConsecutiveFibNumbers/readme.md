The Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence (Fn):

>0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, ...

such as

>F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) with F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1.

Given a number, say prod (for product), we search two Fibonacci numbers F(n) and F(n+1) verifying

>F(n) * F(n+1) = prod.

Your function productFib takes an integer (prod) and returns an array:

`[F(n), F(n+1), true] or {F(n), F(n+1), 1} or (F(n), F(n+1), True)`

depending on the language if F(n) * F(n+1) = prod.

If you don't find two consecutive F(m) verifying `F(m) * F(m+1) = prod` you will return

`[F(m), F(m+1), false] or {F(n), F(n+1), 0} or (F(n), F(n+1), False)`
F(m) being the smallest one such as `F(m) * F(m+1) > prod`.

Examples
```
productFib(714) # should return {21, 34, 1}, 
                # since F(8) = 21, F(9) = 34 and 714 = 21 * 34

productFib(800) # should return {34, 55, 0}, 
                # since F(8) = 21, F(9) = 34, F(10) = 55 and 21 * 34 < 800 < 34 * 55
```
Notes: Not useful here but we can tell how to choose the number n up to which to go: we can use the "golden ratio" phi which is `(1 + sqrt(5))/2` knowing that F(n) is asymptotic to: `phi^n / sqrt(5)`. That gives a possible upper bound to n.

You can see examples in "Example test".
