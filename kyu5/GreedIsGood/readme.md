Greed is a dice game played with five six-sided dice. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to score a throw according to these rules. You will always be given an array with five six-sided dice values.

```
 Three 1's => 1000 points
 Three 6's =>  600 points
 Three 5's =>  500 points
 Three 4's =>  400 points
 Three 3's =>  300 points
 Three 2's =>  200 points
 One   1   =>  100 points
 One   5   =>   50 point
 ```
A single die can only be counted once in each roll. For example, a "5" can only count as part of a triplet (contributing to the 500 points) or as a single 50 points, but not both in the same roll.

Example scoring

```
 Throw       Score
 ---------   ------------------
 5 1 3 4 1   50 + 2 * 100 = 250
 1 1 1 3 1   1000 + 100 = 1100
 2 4 4 5 4   400 + 50 = 450
 ```
