Your task is to convert a given number into a string with commas added for easier readability.  The number should be rounded to 3 decimal places and the commas should be added at intervals of three digits before the decimal point. There does not need to be a comma at the end of the number.

You can be passed both positive and negative numbers.

For example:
```js
commas(1) == "1"

commas(1000) == "1,000"

commas(100.2346) == "100.235"

commas(1000000000.23) == "1,000,000,000.23"

commas(-1) == "-1"

commas(-1000000.123) == "-1,000,000.123"
```
