# 1 Kyu

1 kyu kata represent a proficient programming level. At this level kata are similar to 2 kyu but more challenging. They
may include concepts such as:

* Advanced AI/machine learning algorithms
* Complex interpreters and compilers
* Complex Mini-programs with multiple feature requirements (such as a complete markdown parser)

### Out of respect for the community and to prevent copies in the solutions of these categories, I will not include my possible solutions to these Kata, I will only add links to those that I have solved.
