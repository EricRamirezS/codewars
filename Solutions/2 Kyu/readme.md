2 kyu kata represent a proficient programming level. At this level kata require a mature understanding of complex
programming concepts - concepts such as:

* Complex AI/machine learning algorithms
* Reverse engineering techniques
* Basic interpreters and compilers
* Basic mini-programs with multiple feature requirements (such as a basic markdown parser)
