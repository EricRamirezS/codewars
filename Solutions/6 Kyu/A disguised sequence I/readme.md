Given `u0 = 1, u1 = 2` and the relation `6 un un+1 - 5 un un+2 + un+1 un+2 = 0` calculate `un for any integer n >= 0.`

#Examples

fcn(n) returns `un`: `fcn(17) -> 131072, fcn(21) -> 2097152`

Remark: You can take two points of view to do this kata:

the first one purely algorithmic from the definition of `un`

the second one - not at all mandatory, but as a complement - is to get a bit your head around and find which sequence is hidden behind `un`.
